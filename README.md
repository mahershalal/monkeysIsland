So, with created graph all vertices(islands with connection) is check to get the logest path(bananas ammount)

Get the first node (start) and check the all the Neighborhood, if the node wasnâ€™t visited it is schedule to be checked and every time check the path between the actual path and origin is greater than the value stored.

- VisingData: VisitingData is a dijkstra helper, used to control the queue

- Weight: Used to register island weight and value until island

- Dijkstra: Responsible to used the Dijkstra algorithm to get the better path between two island

- Bridge: Bridge that connect an island to another

- NeighborhoodInfo: Information from neighborhood island, all island connecteds with another
